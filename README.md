# LSM Reservoir App (version-0.8)
Reservoir Applet for tuning Liquid State Machines developed in Matlab 2017a GUI
Simulates a network of randomly connected spiking neurons with LIF model in the reservoir of an LSM and is useful in :   

   * tuning the synaptic weights to get various spiking neural network dynamics (oscillatory, decaying, saturation)
   
   * observe effect of changing individual network parameter to find
   sensitivity of parameters
